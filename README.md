# Devla - selection process assignment

This is a full-stack assignment that handles basic user authentication.

## How to run

More detailed instructions will be added later on, but for now follow these the steps:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Use `cd devla-auth` command to change the current working directory to a newly cloned one.

3. Make sure that you have installed either `Docker Engine and Docker Compose as standalone binaries` or `Docker Desktop`. If you don't have it you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

4. Run `docker ps` or `docker info` to verify it is installed and running.

5. Run `docker compose up` to build and start containers. It will take some when you run it for the first time so be patient until it finishes building everything up.

6. Now you can go to your browser and visit `http://localhost:8001`.

7. And that should be it. Hopefully, you can see the login page and you can start playing with the app. :)

In case of any problems please check out your port. Check out that used ports aren't already used by some other processes.
